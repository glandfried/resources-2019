Overall: I only would have liked to spent more time on casual inference.
Theory: The pedagogical strategy of write the code in real time was great. 
Reproducible Workflows: The name was bigger than their content. It could have been called "One fundamental tool for reproducible workflows".
EWA models and observational data: The subject was great. There were problems with the pedagogical strategy. The content was offered very quickly. There was no feedback from the audience. Handling silences is important to help students comprehend new ideas.
Causal Inference: It would be great to have some bibliography to delve into the subject after the workshop.
